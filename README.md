# PYTHON üêç
### First, my friend. Thak you for take your time to give a look at this repository, your mere atention to me it's very significant.
### So, This reprository it's to save and show some projects of data analysis I created using the colab id and the python language. I want you to you to feel the right to give your feedback whether your it relays on positive or negative (I'm willing to take any assessment as an opportunitie to get better more and more). You can see more details about how the analyses proceded opening the notebooks. üíÉ 
### I made a Machine Learning Model in the "Linear Regression" projects, a Business Analysis in the notebook "Sales" and analysed the Financial Cost in the "House Rent".

# Projects:
## *Linear Regression*
## *Liner Regression 2*
## *Sales*
### I analysed the Sales of an Eletronic Store
### First I wanna show you the slights diference between the same graphics ploted using diferents library
### The first correspond to a plot using plotly and the one bellow is using matplotlib. You can see that the data are more organized in the first picture

## *House Rent*
### I analised the rent price in two citys: Porto and Barcelona
### Bellow, theres a histogram that I plot counting tha number of houses with tha specific rent. We can see that Barcelona offers a great amount of options from lower to larger price rent.
